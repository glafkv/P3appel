Local option!!

To Run:
	make 			- to compile
	statSem <filename>	- to specify a file(can be done with or without .fs19 extension)
	statSem < <filename>	- pipes input from file
	statSem 		- allows user input

Current problems:
I test it with the good files and they all work fine.
Some of the bad files are coming out OK even though they shouldn't be.
Can't seem to figure out why.
